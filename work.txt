Exercise: Setting up a Basic Linux Server

Objective: Set up a Linux server and configure basic services.

Instructions:

1-    Choose a Linux distribution: Select a Linux distribution and setup your work environment.

2-   Secure the server: Update the system packages to the latest versions, configure a strong password for the root user, and disable remote root login.

3-    Configure network settings: Set a static IP address for your server, configure DNS settings, and ensure that the server can access the internet.

4-  Install essential services: Install commonly used services such as SSH (Secure Shell) for remote access, a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) to host a basic website, and a database server (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) for data storage.

5-   Configure firewall: Set up a firewall (e.g., iptables or firewalld) to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic as per your requirements. Open necessary ports for the services you have installed.

6-    Test services: Verify that the installed services are working correctly. For example, ensure you can access the web server's default page from a web browser, connect to the database server, and establish an SSH session to the server.

7-    Implement basic security measures: Enable automatic security updates, configure log monitoring, and set up regular system backups.

8-    Document your setup: Create a detailed documentation outlining the steps you followed, configurations made, and any additional notes or observations.

Remember to research and refer to official documentation and online resources specific to your chosen Linux distribution. This exercise will help you gain hands-on experience with setting up a basic Linux server and familiarize yourself with fundamental system administration tasks.
